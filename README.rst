Nelen en Schuurmans Geoserver Scripts
=====================================

Scripts made for internal use within Nelen en Schuurmans, that may be
useful to others.

It is based on the gsconfig library ( https://github.com/opengeo/gsconfig.py ).

Initially, I am writing a script to copy workspaces, stores and/or
layers from one server to another.
